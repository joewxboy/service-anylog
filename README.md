# EdgeLake Service for  OpenHorizon

EdgeLake is a decentralized network to manage IoT/Edges data. Nodes are compute instances that execute the EdgeLake 
Software and that are part of a nodes network.

The EdgeLake network is using one MASTER Node (is has all the network meta data), as many OPERATOR nodes as required (this is where the data is) and at least one QUERY node (this is where a query for the data is made, nodes can be dual role Query+Operator). The Query node is where the end-user (human or application, Grafana to build a dashboard for example) queries data, it knows from the meta data which Operators to goto and does it peer to peer.

note: the Master node can also be replaced by a Blockchain service & contract : we will not cover this below for the time being

Adding EdgeLake to Open Horizon implementations extends OH value it allows :
- collection of nodes health simply
- extending data queried to other sensors: data usefull to the user (machine rpms for example)


In a typical Open Horizon deployment here are the main elements:

Adding EdgeLake to an existing Open Horizon deployment, the simplest pattern is to locate the Master and Query nodes together 'centrally' with the OH Managenent Hub as below:
<img width="1149" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/308e51d6-73ac-46c2-b3e7-9f1fc8df28a6">

A more practical approach is to have the Query node (at least one) elsewhere as below (avoiding to move
data to the Management Hub : Peer to Peer collection), and one can have as many Query nodes as needed:
<img width="1159" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9ff937f-09fb-4309-96f2-f11241aaea21">


For demonstrating and testing on a single system we created deployment tools:
- 2x .sh for the Management side (deploy Master, deploy Query)
- 1x .sh for the Agent side (deploy Operator during Edge build and initial Agent installation)
- 1x 1 Service Policy for Operator at Edge (deploy Operator into an already deployed Edge using the Horizon deployment tool)

Here is the simplified diagram when deploying on a single physical system: 
<img width="1159" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/761645ad-3af5-49e2-bdf0-c6a3b6f21815">



Back to deployment, with the instructions below you will be able to deploy an integrated OH+EL setup to run a simple dashboard.
Creating a nodes network requires the following steps:
1. Install the EdgeLake Software on one or more computer instances.
2. Configure each installed node (compute instance) such that:
   1. The node joins an exiting network (or creates a new network).
   2. The node offers data management and monitoring services.

# General Configuration of Network

A basic network setup consists of a _master node_, 1 or more _operator nodes_  and a _query_ node - as shown in the image below. 
These nodes can be deployed either on the same physical machine (for testing), or unique machines (real deployments across sites).

![Demo Diagram](imgs/deployment_diagram.png)


## Deploy EdgeLake

In the following directions, the _Master_ and _Query_ nodes will be deployed directly via Docker, while the _Operator_ 
node will be deployed via OpenHorizon.  

Prior to deployment, docker should be [installed via OpenHorizon](Documentation/OpenHorizon_install.md), but may require 
`sudo` permissions to execute docker commands. In addition, `make` command is not installed by default. 
```shell
USER=`whoami` 
sudo groupadd docker 
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER} 
newgrp docker

sudo apt-get -y install make
```

### Master / Query

1. Update the dotenv configuration file for the desired node - [Master](docker-makefiles/edgelake_master.env) | [Query](docker-makefiles/edgelake_query.env)
Make sure the following params get update accordingly:
   * Node Name
   * Company Name
   * LEDGER_CONN associated with Master node - when TCP binding is set to _true_, then 127.0.0.1 as the IP value for LEDGER will not work. 

2. Deploy  Node
```shell
make up EDGELAKE_TYPE=master

make up EDGELAKE_TYPE=query
```
**Note**: EdgeLake version can be updated via DOCKER_IMAGE_VERSION in [Makefile](Makefile)

### Operator

1. Update the dotenv configuration file for the [Operator](docker-makefiles/edgelake_operator.env) node
Make sure the following params get update accordingly:
   * Node Name
   * Company Name
   * LEDGER_CONN - when TCP binding is set to _true_, then 127.0.0.1 as the IP value for LEDGER will not work.
   * Cluster Name 
   * Database name


2. Make sure there aren't any services running - note existing services will redeploy as part of `agent-run` in step
```shell
hzn unregister -f
```

3. Using `publish` command deploy EdgeLake
   * publish-service -- uses [service.definition.json](service.definition.json), which has the default / required values for a deployment of a node 
   * publish-service-policy -- uses [service.policy.json](service.policy.json), which declares the constraints for deploying a node
   * publish-deployment-policy -- Due to the "extra" configurations to deploy an Operator node, the script uses either [generic.json](deployment-policies%2Fgeneric.json) or [operator.json](deployment-policies%2Foperator.json) in [deployment-policies](deployment-policies) 
   * agent-run -- uses [node.policy.json](node.policy.json), which matches the constraints between the configurations to decide servicees to deploy. 
```shell
make publish EDGELAKE_TYPE=operator
```

When deploying a node via OpenHorizon, the following files are used:

### Validate Node

* Test Node -- validate node is accessible,  blockchain is upto date and which processes are running
```shell
make test-node
